# Create a new EAA Application

A Terraform configuration is a complete document written in HCL (Hashicorp Configuration language) that tells Terraform how to manage a given collection of infrastructure.
Configuration files tell Terraform what plugins to install, what infrastructure to create, and what data to fetch.
The main purpose of the Terraform language is declaring resources, which represent infrastructure objects. The following sections describe how to define the resource eaa_application in terraform configuration file.

* ```domain``` - (Required) The type of access domain. "custom", "wapp". Default "custom"
* ```host``` - (Required) The external default hostname for the application.
* ```servers``` - (Optional) EAA application server details. list of dictionaries with following settings
  * origin_host - The IP address or FQDN of the origin server.
  * orig_tls - Enables TLS on the origin server.
  * origin_port - The port number of the origin server.
  * origin_protocol - The protocol of the origin server connection. Either ssh or http.
* ```tunnel_internal_hosts``` - (Optional)
  * host       - The IP address or FQDN of the hsot
  * port_range - the port range of the host
  * proto_type - The protocol of the host. Either "tcp" or "udp"
* ```agents``` - (Optional) EAA application connector details. list of agent names	
* ```popregion``` - (Optional) The target region to deploy the application	
* ```popname``` - (Computed)	 The name for the target pop to deploy the application
* ```auth_enabled``` - (Required) - Is the application authentication enabled
* ```app_authentication``` - (Optional) dictionary with the application authentication data
  * app_idp - Name of the application IDP
    * app_directories - List of application directories
      * name - Name of the dictionary
      * app_groups - list of subset of directory's groups that are assigned to the application.
* ```app_auth``` - (Optional) Application-to-origin authentication method (configured in `advanced_settings`). See [Authentication Parameters](authentication_advsettings.md). Default "none"
* ```wapp_auth``` - (Optional) User-facing authentication at the access page (configured in `advanced_settings`). See [Authentication Parameters](authentication_advsettings.md). Default "form"
